# Drug Diffusion Simulation in Human Tissues

## Overview
This project simulates the diffusion of a drug through human tissues over time using a numerical approach based on Fick's laws of diffusion. The simulation visualizes how drug concentration changes at various depths in the tissue, providing insights into pharmacokinetics and drug delivery systems.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
