# Drug Diffusion Simulation in Human Tissues

## Overview
The **Drug Diffusion Simulation in Human Tissues** project provides a computational model to simulate the diffusion of a drug through human tissues over time. Utilizing Fick's laws of diffusion, this simulation visualizes how drug concentration varies at different depths within the tissue, offering valuable insights for researchers in pharmacology, biomedical engineering, and related fields.

## Features
- **Numerical Simulation:** Implements a finite difference method to model drug diffusion.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Generates an animated plot to illustrate concentration profiles over time.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can easily modify key parameters such as:
  - Diffusion coefficient
  - Length of the tissue
  - Total simulation time
- **Educational Tool:** Serves as a resource for understanding drug delivery mechanisms and pharmacokinetics.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drug-diffusion-simulation.git
   cd drug-diffusion-simulation
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## How It Works
**Diffusion Model:**

Simulates the diffusion process using the finite difference method to solve the diffusion equation.
Models a tissue as a 1D spatial grid with user-defined parameters.
**Visualization:**

Provides dynamic animations that depict the changing drug concentration over time.

**Adjustable Parameters:**

D (Diffusion Coefficient): Controls the speed of diffusion.
L (Tissue Length): Sets the simulated tissue depth.
T (Total Simulation Time): Specifies how long the diffusion is observed.
