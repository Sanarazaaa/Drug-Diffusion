# Drug Diffusion Simulation in Human Tissues

## Overview
The **Drug Diffusion Simulation in Human Tissues** project provides a computational model to simulate the diffusion of a drug through human tissues over time. Utilizing Fick's laws of diffusion, this simulation visualizes how drug concentration varies at different depths within the tissue, offering valuable insights for researchers in pharmacology, biomedical engineering, and related fields.

## Features
- **Numerical Simulation:** Implements a finite difference method to model drug diffusion.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Generates an animated plot to illustrate concentration profiles over time.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can easily modify key parameters such as:
  - Diffusion coefficient
  - Length of the tissue
  - Total simulation time
- **Educational Tool:** Serves as a resource for understanding drug delivery mechanisms and pharmacokinetics.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drug-diffusion-simulation.git
   cd drug-diffusion-simulation
   ```

2. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Ensure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
To run the simulation, execute the following Python script:
```bash
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
```
